         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:62656:5"/> which might hence ariſe, I have in this ſmall Treatiſe propoſed to your ſerious conſideration: Firſt, the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of affliction or difference between the Croſſe and the Crowne. Secondly, the benefit that comes to the ſoule by affliction. Thirdly, what Chriſt hath ſuffered for us. Fourthly, the ends why God afflicts his people. Fifthly, the author of affliction. And theſe five thoughts, as <hi>Davids</hi> five ſmooth ſtones being rightly placed in the ſling of the heart, and levelled by the ſteady hand of faith, will be ſufficiently able to beat down the great <hi>Goliah</hi> of our ſoules deſpaire: firſt, conſider the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the Croſſe and the Crowne; the brevity of ſuffering, the perpetuity of reigning; afflictions are but for a ſhort time, during the time of this preſent life, <hi>I count,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 8.18. 2 Cor. 12.</note> ſaith the Apoſtle. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the time of affliction is ſometime termed a day of triall, ſometimes a night of ſorrow: Heavineſſe may endure for a night, ſaith the Pſalmiſt, but joy comes in the morning; ſometimes to an houre, of watching, as Chriſt ſaid to his three Diſciples,<note place="margin">Matth 26.40.</note> Can you not watch with me one houre? Beſides this, the burthen of afflictions,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 2 12. 2 Cor. 1.2, 3, 4, 5.</note> hath conſolations qualifying; As the ſufferings of Chriſt doe abound, ſo his conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons much more: Bleſſed are they which are perſecuted for righteouſneſſe ſake. Let <hi>Stephen</hi> have his eyes in prayer to ſee the heaven opened, and Jeſus ſtanding at the right hand of God, and he ſhall nor be moved with the ſtones which the Jewes violently throw at him: Let <hi>Moſes</hi> ſee him which is inviſible, and he ſhall not feare <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> but rejoyce rather to ſuffer with the people of God, then to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon: Let <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> conſider for whoſe ſake they
<pb facs="tcp:62656:5"/> are impriſoned, and they will ſing and rejoyce in the midſt of their ſufferings. Secondly, the power of the oppreſſor is limited, his daies are numbred; I have ſaid you are Gods, but ye ſhall dye like men: the rod of the wicked ſhall not alwaies reſt on the backe of the godly, God will either cut off the oppreſſor in his fury, or take the oppreſſed to his mercy; <hi>Statutum eſt omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus ſemel mori,</hi> It is appointed for all men once to dye: <hi>Quicquid generatur corrumpitur, omne ortum interit:</hi> Here is our comfort then, if we dye, we ſhall live like An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells; if we live, we ſhall ſee our enemies dye like men, <hi>&amp; poſt hac ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Chriſt our bleſſed Saviour, God and Man, will one day come to exerciſe a judiciall courſe againſt them, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe God ſhould be unjuſt in rewarding, and the godly of all men moſt miſerable. Secondly,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.4. Luke 24 26. Rom. 8.17. Acts 14.21.

                  <p>Affliction to the ſoule, is as phyſicke to the body, more wholeſome, then toothſome; for although ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply in it ſelfe it be not good, yet being preſcribed, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected and ordered by the wiſe hand of God, it often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times proves very uſefull and advantagious to the ſoul: <hi>David</hi> ſpeakes upon his owne experience,<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.71.</note> that it was good for him; and <hi>Paul</hi> affirmes the ſame, There is no affliction for the preſent joyous, but it brings forth the quiet fruits of righteouſneſſe. <hi>Adam</hi> in the garden of pleaſure, was overcome by the Serpent; when <hi>Iob</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the dunghill of miſery, was more then a conquerer: Affliction makes men mourne for their ſins, <hi>&amp; beati
